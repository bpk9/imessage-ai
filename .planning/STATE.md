## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- CLI-only (no web UI): Simpler scope, ships faster, fits developer tool audience
- Local-first with cloud opt-in: Privacy is key selling point but pragmatic about quality
- REPL-style chat (not one-shot): Matches user mental model of conversation, enables follow-ups
- Insights as first-class feature: Differentiator vs generic "chat with docs" tools

### Pending Todos

None yet.
